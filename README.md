It's good to be able to do at least something, because not being able to do anything or taking someone else's is boring and the meaning of being is lost. That's why I like writing code, at least partially, and I also love modeling, but that was so long ago...

Although my fictitious pseudonym Ezer is my pseudonym, but for me it is a real name, although it is not real, but for me and everyone who is interested in me, it is the most real and genuine, so you can contact me by pseudonym here and in real life. ('-') Each person has his own name, but he is not given the right to choose initially, so everyone should have his own, real name that he likes and suits.
